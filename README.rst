Optese implements the 'greedy-set-cover' algorithm from Cormen *et al.* (1990) [CORMEN90]_ for optimal text selection.  

I initially wrote optese for the WISPR_ project at the University of Wales Bangor.  However, the code seems to no longer be available at their site.  As I receive occasional requests for the code, I thought I should host optese myself here.  The wispr tag comtains the original code as (was) hosted by UWB.

Further detailts forthcoming.  In the meantime, please see the py/README.
